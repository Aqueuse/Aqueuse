Hello, I'm **Aqueuse**  \*

Actually, I'm working on being a master of **Java**, with a second release of  <img src="https://github.com/Aqueuse/NekoV2/blob/master/icon.png" width="32" height="32" />, my kitty desktop app and by making some web oriented projets in Spring that will start soon.

I'm an accomplished carftwoman, both in software development and more traditionnal technologies 🛠 <br> <center>and I love eating a cheesecake with a good coffee ❤🍰☕</center>

You can start making my dream come true by [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/V7V5AEGCL)

\* It means Watery because my pseudonym was "*llo*" before, which sound like water in french language but "*llo*" is too short for some websites

But, wait... what's happened to my repositories !? 😱
