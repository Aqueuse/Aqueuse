Hello, I'm Aqueuse* 

Actually, I'm working on being a master of Java, with a second release of Neko, my kitty desktop app by making some web oriented projets in Spring that will start soon.

I'm an accomplish carftwoman, both in software development and more traditionnal technologies <br> and I love eating a cheesecake with a good coffee ‚ù§üç∞‚òï
